# tinyproxy.conf: Custom configuration for docker-univpn
#
# This configuration assumes Tinyproxy will run in the container.

# Port: The port Tinyproxy will listen on for HTTP proxy requests
Port 8888

# Listen: Listen on all available network interfaces in the container
Listen 0.0.0.0

# Allow: Allow connections from any IP address.
# Adjust for security if needed (e.g., Allow 192.168.1.0/24)
# If no Allow rules are specified, the default action is to allow all.
# If any Allow rules are present, the default action is to DENY,
# so we explicitly allow all if 0.0.0.0/0 is desired.
Allow 0.0.0.0/0

# User/Group: Set the user and group that tinyproxy will run as after
# binding to the port. Running as non-root is a good security practice.
User nobody
Group nobody

# Timeout: The maximum number of seconds of inactivity a connection is
# allowed to have before it is closed by tinyproxy.
Timeout 600

# DefaultErrorFile: The HTML file that gets sent if there is no specific
# ErrorFile defined for an HTTP error.
DefaultErrorFile "/usr/share/tinyproxy/default.html"

# StatFile: The HTML file for the statistics page.
StatFile "/usr/share/tinyproxy/stats.html"

# LogFile: Allows you to specify the location where information should be logged to.
LogFile "/var/log/tinyproxy.log"

# LogLevel: Set the logging level. Info is quite verbose and useful for debugging.
LogLevel Info

# Upstream: IMPORTANT - Forward all HTTP proxy requests through the SOCKS5 proxy (Danted)
# Danted is running on localhost (127.0.0.1) on port 1080 inside the container.
# If you decide to make Tinyproxy independent and directly use the VPN,
# you should comment out or remove the 'Upstream' line below.
#Upstream socks5 127.0.0.1:1080

# MaxClients: Maximum number of simultaneous clients.
MaxClients 100

# ViaProxyName: Use a custom name in the Via header instead of the real hostname.
ViaProxyName "tinyproxy"
