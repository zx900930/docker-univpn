    # --- Network & Privileges ---
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN # Crucial: Allows modifying network interfaces, routes (needed by VPNs)

    # --- !!! IMPORTANT NOTE on Privileges !!! ---
    # NET_ADMIN is often sufficient, but some VPN clients might need more.
    # If UniVPN fails to establish connection or modify routes properly,
    # you might need full privileges and host network mode.
    # UNCOMMENT the following lines ONLY IF NECESSARY and understand the security risks.
    # Using privileged or host network significantly reduces container isolation.
    #
    # privileged: true                # Grants full host device access
    # network_mode: host              # Uses host's network, 'ports' section below is ignored

    # --- Grant Access to TUN Device ---
    # Allows the container to create TUN/TAP interfaces by accessing the host's control device.
    # Requires /dev/net/tun to exist on the HOST system (load 'tun' module if needed: sudo modprobe tun)
    devices:
      - "/dev/net/tun:/dev/net/tun"

    # --- Set Specific MAC Address ---
    # Reads the SPOOF_MAC variable from the .env file or host environment.
    # Ensure the format is valid (e.g., 00:11:22:33:44:55)
    # THIS ONLY WORKS IF network_mode IS NOT set to 'host'.
    mac_address: ${SPOOF_MAC:-02:42:ac:11:00:01}

    ports:
      # Note: 'ports' mapping is ignored if network_mode: host is enabled above.
      - "1080:1080" # SOCKS5 Proxy Port
      - "8888:8888" # HTTP Proxy Port

    # --- Environment Variables ---
    environment:
      # VPN Credentials (REQUIRED)
      - VPN_USERNAME=${VPN_USERNAME}
      - VPN_PASSWORD=${VPN_PASSWORD}

      # --- Enable Auto Reconnect ---
      - AUTO_RECONNECT=${AUTO_RECONNECT:-false}

      # --- What IP to ping to check internet? (e.g. 1.1.1.1 or your company internal server) ---
      - RECONNECT_PING_TARGET=${RECONNECT_PING_TARGET:-1.1.1.1}

      # --- How many seconds to wait before starting to ping (Time for you to type password) ---
      - RECONNECT_GRACE_PERIOD=${RECONNECT_GRACE_PERIOD:-60}

      # You can add other ENV variables needed by the container/app here
      # Example (already set in Dockerfile, but could be overridden):
      # - TZ=Asia/Shanghai
      # - VNC_RESOLUTION=1920x1080
      - DEBUG_MODE=true

    # --- Optional: Volumes ---
    # If you need to persist UniVPN configuration or logs outside the container:
    volumes:
      - ./univpn_config:/home/vpnuser/UniVPN
    #   - ./univpn_logs:/usr/local/UniVPN/log
